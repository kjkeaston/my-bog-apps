Do or do not. There is no try.

### Reflection
This went pretty well over all. Feel like I am somewhat getting the hang of it. Was feeling pretty comfortable with the routes by the end and was writing them all at once without looking at and leaving commented out. Still a little confused on when to use `@creature =` vs `creature =` in the creature_controller. Also, writing html in the ruby icecream cones is still a little wonky but I think I'm getting it more now. 

### Tips for others
Watch those commas in the `routes.rb` file and pay attention to plural vs singular instances of "creature"
